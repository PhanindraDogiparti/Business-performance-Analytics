# Business Performance Analytics

## 📚 Overview
This project analyzes the sales performance of a hypothetical retail company, "Superstore," using a publicly available dataset. It evaluates sales outcomes, identifies trends, and develops strategies to enhance profitability. Key tasks include querying data with Apache Hive on a Hadoop Sandbox, visualizing insights in R, and building a predictive sales model using PySpark.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Public dataset from Kaggle.  
- **Features:** Customer details, products, regions, sales figures, etc.  
- **Time Period:** January 2014 - December 2017.  
- **Size:** 9,995 rows and 21 columns.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Querying:** Extracted insights using Apache Hive on Hadoop Sandbox.  
- **Visualization:** Sales and profit trends visualized with R.  
- **Predictive Modeling:** Linear regression model built with PySpark, achieving an R² score of 0.85.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R  
- **Big Data Tools:** Apache Hive, Hadoop HDFS (Sandbox)  
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** PySpark, Pandas, Matplotlib  

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Cleaned and pre-processed the dataset using Python.  
   - Loaded the dataset into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).  
   - Performed data transformations for analysis.  

2. **Data Querying and Analysis:**  
   - Used Apache Hive in a Hadoop Sandbox environment for querying.  
   - Processed data with HiveQL to identify sales trends, profitable regions, and customer segments.  

3. **Visualization:**  
   - Analyzed the queried data and visualized insights with R.  

4. **Modeling:**  
   - Built a predictive sales model using PySpark.  
   - Trained and evaluated a linear regression model with an R² score of 0.85.  

## 💡 Key Insights
- The **West region** and **Technology products** were the most profitable.  
- **Consumer segments** contributed the highest profits.  
- The **Central region** had high revenue but lower profit margins, indicating room for improvement.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional features like advertising spend and marketing data.  
- Experiment with advanced models, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.  
- Develop APIs for real-time sales prediction and deployment.
